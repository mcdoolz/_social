# _social
A social network link plug in module for Drupal 7; super simple to use.

If you have font awesome installed on your site, this module will use those classnames to provide an anchor wrapping an icon and label for each url pasted into the configuration page.

For each link you wish displayed, copy and paste your social network URL into a field.  The code matches a font awesome classname to the url and if a match comes up, the network link is generated.  The rest is up to your CSS skills.  Don't like the icon on the right?  Float it left.  Want colour per network?  Each anchor and label is named for the network and the icon sits separate from the label so you can have different font sizes.
